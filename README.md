# BAmazon-
## Description

This application implements a simple command line based storefront using the npm inquirer package and the MySQL database backend together with the npm mysql package. The application presents two interfaces: customer and manager.

## MySQL Database Setup

In order to run this application, you should have the MySQL database already set up on your machine. If you don't, visit the [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/installing.html) page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once you have MySQL isntalled, you will be able to create the Bamazon database and the products table with the SQL code found in [Bamazon.sql](https://github.com/estomm01/BAmazon-/blob/master/bamazon.sql). Run this code inside your terminal, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Bamazon customer and manager interfaces.
